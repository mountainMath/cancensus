\title{Query the CensusMapper API for vectors using exact, semantic, or keyword search}
\usage{
find_census_vectors(query, dataset, type = "all", query_type = "exact", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{The term or phrase to search for e.g. \code{'Oji-cree'}.
Search queries are case insensitive.}

\item{dataset}{The dataset to query for available vectors, e.g. \code{'CA16'}.
To see a list of available datasets: \code{list_census_datasets()}}

\item{type}{One of \code{'all'}, \code{'total'}, \code{'male'} or \code{'female'}.
If specified, only return aggregations of specified `type`. By default, only
the \code{'total'} aggregation will be returned.}

\item{query_type}{One of \code{exact}, \code{'semantic'} or \code{'keyword'}.
By default, assumes exact string matching, but the alternatives may be better
options in some cases. See description section for more details on query types.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to internal functions.}
}
\description{
Query the available list of Census vectors based on their label and return
details including vector code. Default search behaviour expects an exact match, but
keyword or semantic searches can be used instead by setting \code{query_type='keyword'} or
\code{query_type = 'semantic'} instead. Keyword search is useful when looking to explore
Census vectors based on broad themes like "income" or "language". Keyword search seperates
the query into unigrams and returns Census vectors with matching words, ranked by incidence
of matches. Semantic search is designed for more precise searches while allowing room for error
for spelling or phrasing, as well as for finding closely related vector matches. Semantic search
separates the query into n-grams and relies on string distance measurement using a generalized
Levenshtein distance approach.

Some census vectors return population counts segmented by \code{Female} and \code{Male} populations, in
addition to a total aggregate. By default, query matches will return matches for the \code{Total}
aggregation, but can optionally return only the \code{Female} or \code{Male} aggregations by adding
\code{type = 'female'} or \code{type = 'male'} as a parameter.

\examples{
find_census_vectors('Oji-cree', dataset = 'CA16', type = 'total', query_type = 'exact')

find_census_vectors('commuting duration', dataset = 'CA11', type = 'female', query_type = 'keyword')

find_census_vectors('after tax income', dataset = 'CA16', type = 'total', query_type = 'semantic')

\dontrun{
# This incorrect spelling will return a warning that no match was found,
# but will suggest trying semantic or keyword search.
find_census_vectors('Ojibwey', dataset = 'CA16', type = 'total')

# This will find near matches as well
find_census_vectors('Ojibwey', dataset = 'CA16', type = 'total', query_type = "semantic")

find_census_vectors('commute duration', dataset = 'CA16', type = 'female', query_type = 'keyword')

find_census_vectors('commute duration', dataset = 'CA11', type = 'all', query_type = 'keyword')

find_census_vectors('ukrainian origin', dataset = 'CA16', type = 'total', query_type = 'keyword')
